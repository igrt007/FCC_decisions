# FCC_decisions
My solutions of workshops, labs and certification projects during my Python learning on www.freecodecamp.org
The purpose of publishing my solution is so that others can get acquainted if they get stuck on one of the steps of the solution (say, 30 minutes of concentrated but unsuccessful attempts), I do not advise you to watch until you, as a beginner, have tried the methods described here: https://forum.freecodecamp.org/t/how-to-get-help-when-you-are-stuck-coding/19514
I do not recommend using my solutions (especially if you, as a beginner get in stuck), because it will deprive you of practice. I have published my solutions in order to familiarize myself with the GitHub and one day I will release a stingy tear from nostalgia looking at where I started
